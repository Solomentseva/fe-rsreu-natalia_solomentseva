<h1>Task 7</h1>

<p>
"But <span class="underline
">I must explain</span> to you how all this mistaken idea 
of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I 
will give you a complete account of the system, and expound 
the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
the master-builder of human happiness. <span class="line-through">No one rejects, dislikes, 
or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because 
those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
 encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
 Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires 
 to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, 
 but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
 and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</span> To take a trivial 
 example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
 except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right 
 to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has 
 no annoying consequences, <span class="underline">or one who avoids a pain that produces
 no resultant pleasure?"</span>
